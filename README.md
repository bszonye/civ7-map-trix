better map tools for Civilization VII

## tile ownership details
claimed tiles show which settlement they belong to and who owns it,
along with their civilization and relationship to you.  city-states list
their unique bonuses.

## detailed building status
buildings show whether they are Ageless or obsolete, damaged or
incomplete.  obsolete buildings list when they were built.  the building
panel shows completed Quarters, including names and bonuses for unique
quarters.

## adjacency bonuses highlighted
each building shows its bonus yield type as a colored ring around the
building icon: **green** for food, **red** for production, **yellow**
for gold, **blue** for science, **purple** for culture, **orange** for
happiness, **teal** for influence, and colorless for warehouse
buildings.  the ring **glows** if the building meets the criteria for a
Quarter: complete, undamaged, and from the current Age or Ageless.  if
both buildings glow, the tile is a Quarter.

## settlement connections
City Center tiles show a summary of **connected settlements,** listing
the number of connected cities and towns.  city connections determine
where towns can send food, and the total connections determine the bonus
when creating a Hub Town specialization.

## warning banners
a red banner highlights enemy territory and units, including hostile
independents. a bronze banner highlights important tile effects like
temporary fortifications, floods, and storms.

## readable yields
the tooltip adds a column to the yield table with the **total yield**
under a hexagon icon.  the yield banner at the top of the screen has
clearer text, on backgrounds that match the tooltip colors.

## bug fixes
the city growth mode now shows cursor feedback during tile selection.
fixes a bug in the base game.
