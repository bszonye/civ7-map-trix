# Map Trix 3.6.4
better map tools for Civilization VII

## better tooltips
color highlights emphasize important map features:  terrain obstacles,
enemy territory and units, building types, and more.  hold down Ctrl or
Shift to change the level of detail, or set your preferences in the
Options menu.

- compact: Ctrl
- verbose: Shift
- hidden: Ctrl+Shift

## better yield banner
the system bar adds new backgrounds to the empire yield banner, with
more legible text and color coding to match the tooltips.

## more lens layers
six new decoration layers offer guidance and customization options.

- borders:  optionally turn off all borders for a more scenic map
- city limits:  outline each settlement instead of whole empires
- discoveries:  mark the location of goody huts and dig sites
- fortifications:  show which tiles are fortified and who controls them
- religion:  see exactly which tiles to visit with your missionaries
- roads:  overlay a map of the road and railroad network
- terrain:  highlight terrain features that block movement or vision

activate layers in the minimap or with configurable shortcut keys.

## more lenses
new Commander and Religion lenses activate automatically when you select
appropriate units.  the Commander lens can optionally include commander,
military, and recon units.
