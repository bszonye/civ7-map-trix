# Map Trix
better map tools for Civilization VII

## tile ownership details
claimed tiles show which settlement they belong to and who owns it,
along with their civilization and relationship to you.  city-states list
their unique bonuses.

## detailed building status
buildings show whether they are Ageless or obsolete, damaged or
incomplete.  obsolete buildings list when they were built.  the building
panel shows completed Quarters, including names and bonuses for unique
quarters.

## adjacency bonuses highlighted
each building shows its bonus yield type as a colored ring around
the building icon: green for food, red for production, yellow for gold,
blue for science, purple for culture, orange for happiness, teal for
influence, and colorless for warehouse buildings.  the ring glows if the
building meets the criteria for a Quarter: complete, undamaged, and from
the current Age or Ageless.  if both buildings glow, the tile is a
Quarter.

## settlement connections
City Center tiles show a summary of connected settlements, listing the
number of connected cities and towns.  city connections determine where
towns can send food, and the total connections determine the bonus when
creating a Hub Town specialization.

## warning banners
a red banner highlights enemy territory and units, including hostile
independents. a bronze banner highlights important tile effects like
temporary fortifications, floods, and storms.

## yield totals
every tile shows the total of all its yields in the rightmost column,
under a bronze hexagon.

## bug fixes
