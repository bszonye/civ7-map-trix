# Map Trix 1.5.0
better map tools for Civilization VII

## spot important map details
Map Trix shows you what you're pointing at:

- geography and movement
- civilizations, cities, and towns
- buildings and other improvements
- total yields
- rival units

## geography
the top of the tooltip describes the land, with emphasis on hazards and
obstacles.  color highlights warn you of fortifications, damaging
effects, and terrain features that can stop your movement.

## civilization
see which settlement claims each tile, who owns it, and their atttitude
toward you.  hover over the city center to see additional information
about connected settlements, religion, and fresh water.

## buildings
everything constructible goes here: buildings, improvements, and
wonders.  city-states, unique quarters, and wonders show their names and
special abilities.  buildings show their yield types as colored rings
around the building icons:  **green** for food, **yellow** for gold, and
so on.  a glowing ring means that a building is complete and up-to-date,
and two glowing buildings make a Quarter.

## yields
the last column shows the total of all yields under a bronze hexagon.

## compatibility with other mods
known interactions:

- **Sukritact's Simple UI Adjustments: compatible.**  when both mods are
  installed, the Map Trix tooltip replaces Sukritact's version.
- **zhekoff's Colorful Top Panel: compatible.**  when both mods are
  installed, zhekoff's yield banner replaces the Map Trix version.
- **TCS Improved Plot Tooltip: incompatible.**  both mods enhance the
  same feature in different ways.

- Italian (translated by leonardfactory)
- Korean (translated by Hotsolidinfill)
