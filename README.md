## tile ownership details
claimed tiles show the city, town, or village they belong to, the owning
leader and civilization, and their relationship to you.  city-states
also show their unique bonuses.

## detailed building status

incomplete.  obsolete buildings show when they were built.  the building
panel shows completed quarters, including names and rules for unique
quarters.

## adjacency bonuses highlighted

icon.  the ring glows if the building meets the criteria for urban
quarters: current, complete, and undamaged.

## warning banners
a red banner highlights enemy territory and units, including hostile
independents. a bronze banner highlights important tile effects like
temporary fortifications, floods, and storms.

## yield totals
